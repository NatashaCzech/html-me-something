  <p>Once upon a time, I was fortunate to travel up the coast of California from Los Angeles to San Francisco. This was one of the greatest trips I have been on. While the 
        trip overall was great, it was one stop in particular that was my favorite. Since that stop along Highway 1, I've been saying; "Take me Back, Big Sur!"
    </p>

    <h2 id="scenery">The Scenery</h2>
    <p>Big Sur is gorgeous! The coastal stretch of land is full of hills, trees, and salty sea air. I suppose it goes without saying that visiting Pfeiffer Beach was 
        one of my favorite perks of our visit to Big Sur. This beach is tucked away like a secret universe. Many will say that the giant Sequoia tress are the leading ladies
        of the stage that is big Sur, but for me, it's the unpopulated beach with blue ocean scenes stretching off in to the distance.

    <h2>Home For a Night</h2>
    <p>For our visit to Big Sur, we were lucky to stay at the most amazing house. Built by an architect in the 1970's, you could feel the influence of homebuilder's love 
        of structure being one with it's natural surroundings. The house faded into the hill that it was built on.

    <h2>The Food</h2>
    <p>In a word, yum. We ate the Big Sur bakery and there isn't a thing there that isn't amazing. Everything lovingly made, from scratch by local artists of dough!</p>
